# SmoothTilt
SmoothTilt is a tool that allows for quick and easy tilt effect on UI elements, cameras or 2D/3D  objects. Tested on Unity 2019.2.6 (but it should work on previous and following versions).

#### FEATURES:
- Apply easy and smooth tilt to any object
- Control the range of the tilt
- Adjust the smoothness and speed of the effect
- Supports mouse, touch, gamepad or keyboard input
- In mouse/touch input it supports local mode (the effect only takes place when input is within the object bounds)
- Supports UI elements, 2D and 3D objects

#### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Add the script "SmoothTilt.cs" to the object you want to apply the effect
2. Adjust the parameters as you see fit
3. Hit Play and Voilá!

**Note:** This sample project includes a unity package so you can use this "plugin" in your own projects.
